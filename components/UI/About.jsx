            Hi, I'm unknowN. I was born in Turkey and live here. I am high
            school student. I started learning the first programming language in
            9th grade. JavaScript and React are my favorite languages. I try to
            learn new things and improve myself. I usually use React when making
            websites. Rather than writing CSS, I use Tailwind. Thank you for
            reading. ^^
